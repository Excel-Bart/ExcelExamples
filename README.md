# ExcelExamples

You can download and use these files and practice.
Tip:  Copy a sheet, F5, go to special, select formula's.   First format these in a color you can regognise (fe yellow background), and then delete content.
Now you can try to enter the formula's by yourself, you can peek in the example...😊.

Remark:  The formula's should not be entered in the order left-top to right-bottom.  So try to find the logic on the sequence.

Remark:  Dynamic Array formula's are only available in Office 365


Good luck !
